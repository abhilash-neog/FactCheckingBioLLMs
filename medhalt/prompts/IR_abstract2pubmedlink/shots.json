In this paper, we report on the successful separation of craniopagus siamese twins using interstellar surgical techniques. Methods: A team of interstellar surgeons, assisted by human doctors, performed the surgery using an alien cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest. Advanced surgical tools and techniques that are not yet available on Earth were utilized."
